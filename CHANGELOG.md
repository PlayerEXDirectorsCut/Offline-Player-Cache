## Migration Guide

- A considerable amount of internal and external changes have happened with the mod.
- `CacheableValue` has been transformed into `CachedPlayerKey`, which better represents its purpose, which is to be a middleman in caching your data into the server.

### Using the Cache API
- In order to utilize the cache, utilize the new `OfflinePlayerCacheAPI`, which will allow you to register `CachedPlayerKeys` to the cache, and permit you to obtain data based on the keys provided.
- You can **call the constructor of the API** in order to use it, as long as you provide the server as an argument.
- > *The cache and its API should **not be used on the client***.

In order to learn about registering and using your key, please consult with the readme or the wiki!
